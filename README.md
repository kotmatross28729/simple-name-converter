## What?
In Minecraft 1.13, some texture names have changed, so resource packs from 1.13+ do not work on older versions.
Of course, you can manually rename the entire file, but ... is it worth it?
Not anymore! This script automatically renames files, you just need to select 1 of the 2 available options:

1) Converting new names to old ones.
For example wooden_axe will become wood_axe, golden_apple will become apple_golden, etc.

2) Converting old names to new ones.
Same as 1 but in reverse


## How to use?

1. Download the repository (Code -> Download ZIP)
and unzip it to any folder (for example, create a new folder on your desktop)

2. Unzip your resource pack into the "texture converter" folder

3. Run "simple name converter.exe"

4. In the console window that opens, select the option you need (enter a number, 0 or 1, (0 - converts new names to old ones.
 1 - converts old names to new ones)) , and then press Enter
5. The names of the files in your resource pack should be renamed

6. Pack the resource pack files from the "texture converter" folder into a ZIP archive (or delete the previous files of the original resource pack and replace with these)

7. Place the resulting ZIP archive into the .minecraft\resourcepacks folder

8. Done!
