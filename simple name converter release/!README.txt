4. In the console window that opens, select the option you need (enter a number (0 or 1), 0 - converts new names to old ones, for example golden_apple, it will be apple_golden, or wooden_sword will be wood_sword.

5. The names of the files in your resource pack should be renamed

6.Pack the resource pack files from the "texture converter" folder into a ZIP archive (or delete the previous files of the original resource pack and replace with these)
